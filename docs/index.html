<h1 class="unnumbered" id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>Synthi 100 is only made in very small quantities, and because every
aspect of its design is under constant review with an eye to
improvement, each example of the machine is slightly different. This
makes it impracticable to produce a definitive, once-for-all handbook,
and for some time there has been no handbook at all, since we are aware
that purchasers of this instrument are in the main already experienced
in the use of voltage controlled equipment and the general techniques of
electronic music, and in most cases will have had extensive
demonstrations before taking delivery. At the same time we have been
conscious that some users have simply not grasped the possibilities at
their command and have seriously under-rated and underused the
capabilities which S.100 offers, partly because there is no other
synthesizer with which to compare it. Apart from possessing a number of
devices unique to EMS, the digital sequencer gives S.100 a degree of
user control which can only be rivalled by fully computerised studios at
many times the cost.</p>
<p>Because of the almost limitless possibilities of the studio, it is
not easy to attempt a survey of its capabilities, and the following
pages should be regarded as an “intelligent user’s guide”. We expect
each owner to add his own notes and comments, individual calibrations of
particular interest, etc. To take a particular example, the eight
voltage controlled filters have always been built to an exacting
specification, but because our research and development department
considered there was room for improvement the circuitry has been
slightly modified almost with each example manufactured. The settings
and procedures given in this book may therefore not precisely apply to a
given machine, but the method of taking response curves etc., is still
valid and useful in all cases.</p>
<p>If in doubt about a particular device, look it up in the contents
list and read the typical uses given, but regard this as a starting
point rather than a complete survey of possibilities; the great strength
of voltage control lies in the enormous variety of inter-dependencies
available, and in S.100 these are so numerous that no handbook can begin
to cover them.</p>
<p>We have divided the descriptions of the devices into groups of
similar general purpose, such as Source or Treatment, Digital or
Analogue, but some devices have several applications and therefore
appear in more than one section.</p>
<p>If you consider that the presentation or contents of this handbook
are not satisfactory, we would be pleased to know about this, and the
purpose of the loose leaf method of binding is to make it possible to
amend and add material easily. No doubt you will also wish to exchange
views and ideas with other S.100 owners, and to this end we include a
list of purchasers up to the time of issue of this copy - though we
cannot of course guarantee that some of these machines have not changed
hands.</p>
<div class="warning" title="VERY IMPORTANT">
<p>In earlier S.100 design, patch pins of 2K7 or shorting pins were
often used. The patching system now employs virtual-earth summing nodes
and 100K (white) pins are standard. A shorting pin is
<strong>never</strong> used, since this would connect a high-current
source directly to the summing node. Apart from gross distortion, damage
may result to the input. Red (2K7) pins are used only for oscilloscope
patching.</p>

Layout</h2>
<p>The designer of a synthesizer can go about his work in two quite
different ways. He can aim to make the instrument reasonably easy to use
by reducing the number of decisions to be made by the user. This means
fitting switches or permanent connections between various components in
order to reduce the size of the patch (interconnection field with a
large number of choices — like a telephone exchange) which the operator
has to control for himself. The trouble is that the fixed decisions
reflect what the designer would like, but not necessarily what you would
like. Alternatively, he can design a ‘no compromise’ instrument in which
every decision has to be made by the user and a virtually limitless
number of configurations are possible. Such machines are not
particularly easy to use well, and the larger the machine the more
difficult it becomes, but we make no apology for following this second
course when we designed the S.100. On the other hand, after first making
it difficult, we added a powerful assistant in the shape of the
<em>Digital Sequencer</em>, which is the most helpful aid to the
synthesizer user ever invented. All the same there are 7,200 individual
patch points in the S.100 (though we admit that not quite all of them
are effectively operational), and thought and experience must be
combined if really good work is to result (and the capability is there
for such work).</p>
<p>For this reason we strongly recommend any potential user of S.100 to
spend a lot of time ‘training’ on a small synthesizer such as our VCS3,
Synthi A or AKS, so that the methods of using matrix board patching, the
use of control voltages etc. — in fact all the basic groundwork of EMS
voltage controlled studios, is thoroughly mastered before attempting to
use the S.100. In this handbook, therefore, it will be assumed that the
reader is already familiar with the operation of the smaller
machines.</p>
<p>Because the possibilities are so large, any attempt to provide lists
of suitable patches, etc., would be fruitless. We shall explain exactly
what each device does, and offer typical examples of its use, but after
that it is up to your own musical imagination and your increasing
experience with S.100 to build the sounds you think of.</p>
<p>Don’t be timid about using the resources of the machine — or imagine
that there is only one way to go about solving a problem. For example,
it is easy to settle for only one or two ways of creating a timbre. In
fact, even without combining several techniques (which can easily be
done) there are at least eight different methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Addition of shaped waveforms from one source</li>
<li>Additive timbres from a number of oscillators locked by
synchronising inputs and tuned to desired partials</li>
<li>Subtractive timbre derivation by manually controlled filters
(8–octave filter bank for formants, output filter on each channel)</li>
<li>Subtractive timbre derivation by using dynamic voltage controlled
filters (of which there are eight)</li>
<li>Using the filters themselves as sources, in oscillatory mode, with
or without inputs as well</li>
<li>Multiplicative timbre derivation by ring modulation, either with
several oscillators (synchronised or not) or one source with frequency
doubling and/or halving configurations (S.100 has three ring modulators,
which may be cascaded or paralleled in many different ways)</li>
<li>Other modulation techniques (a.m. and/or f.m.) by multiple control
of filters and oscillators</li>
<li>Digital loops in the sequencer, by which controllable discrete
phenomena are speeded up many hundreds of times by increasing clock rate
so that they become audio frequency phenomena.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any of these basic approaches can be further modified by
e.g. reverberation (itself voltage controllable) or numerous control
influences, some periodic, some asynchronous and some random. Or of
course several techniques can be combined to produce timbre changes of
great subtlety — and we haven’t even considered any of the ways of
incorporating a noise content into the timbre.</p>
<p>This is not an acoustics or musical textbook, so (as with practice on
a small synthesizer) we must assume some previous knowledge of the
nature of sound and how to manipulate it. Mental analysis of the
contents of the mind’s ear into likely configurations of actual devices
comes with practice. Some will find block diagrams useful before
translating these into a practical patch. Others will find it easier to
work onto patch dope sheets (you will find a supply of these at Section
8). Others again may incorporate dope sheets into various forms of
notation, or work straight on to the machine from an idea.</p>
<p>The above timbre example — a small fraction of a larger problem — was
intended to encourage rather than daunt, in the sense that there are
riches to be found if you take the trouble to find them.</p>
<p>The guiding principles behind the design of the S.100 were (1) to
make a synthesizer in which there would be no compromise to versatility;
(2) to extend and enhance the control principles already proved highly
successful in our small synthesizers — i.e. matrix patching, bi–polar
control voltages, direct coupled circuits which can be used both in
sub–audio and audio roles; (3) to include more of everything found in
the small synthesizers, but also greatly enhance the specifications of
such devices as the Envelope Shaper, include many extra devices such as
High Pass–to–Resonating Filters (as well as Low Pass), Envelope
Followers, Slew Limiters, Pitch–to–Voltage Converter and Eight Octave
Filter Bank; (4) to put the whole of this elaborate network of analogue
controls under the command of a digital sequencer, giving an accuracy of
performance hitherto undreamed of in analogue synthesizers.</p>
<p>Having decided upon the array of devices we would need, we were faced
with nearly 120 inputs and the same number of outputs. Apart from the
very high cost of a matrix board this size, it would have been extremely
unwieldy, so instead of splitting one board into Signals and Controls
(as in VCS3, Synthi A series), we specified two boards of 60 x 60, a
Signal Board and a Control Board (left and right respectively). There
were some difficult decisions — borderline cases where a device (e.g. an
oscillator) may be a signal or a control. But provision is made for
cross–patching, and it is also possible to use jumper leads from patch
to patch. The input Amplifiers and Output Channels come up on both
boards, and the first four Output Channel inputs appear on the Control
Board as well as the Signal Board. Before going any further, and it is
not necessary to understand all the devices at this stage, study the
boards carefully, and identify all outputs to the patch (horizontal
rows) with their appropriate panel controls. Find also the equivalent
vertical columns referring to signal inputs (where applicable). The
columns on the Control Board do not have any panel controls, because our
design policy is to equip all outputs with level controls, and vary
input levels from the controlling device. In cases where you wish to
feed the same control to different devices at different levels, a
selection of different pin resistances can be used (three are supplied
as standard, and you can add more yourself).</p>
<p>In Section 2 and 3 you will find all the analogue signal and control
devices described, with suggestions for learning their use. Beginning
with simple patches, you can build up elaborate configurations in which
many parameters are being dynamically controlled.</p>
<p>You may be puzzled to find that three devices — the Pitch–to–Voltage
Converter and the 2 Envelope Followers, have inputs on the Signal Board
and Outputs on the Control Board. This is because they are
signal–to–control converters, and one of their main functions is in real
time transformations of live instrumental inputs. They are described in
Section 5.</p>
<p>Functionally, the sequencer is the most elaborate device in S.100,
and it is a very powerful control instrument. The programming of
analogue control is a matter of delicate adjustment, as you will know
from your experience of small synthesizers. On S.100 you may easily have
over 100 pins contributing to a patch, and to control all this with
accuracy from the two keyboards, the two joysticks, or from the
attack–dependent envelope shaper trapezoids or the various free running
controls such as the slow oscillators (10, 11, 12) or the random
generator, can be a difficult matter when a number of voltages have to
change from event to event, or dynamically during them. The sequencer is
digital, and operates by storing precise numbers which are converted
into equally precise voltages to control to the devices. As you put data
into the memory you also hear what you are playing, and on play back you
hear it again exactly the same. When adding new voices you can continue
to hear any sound previously recorded, and three completely different
sets of voltages can be stored, controlling (if you like) quite
different types of sound. If you don’t want to ‘play’ your sequence in
real time, you don’t have to — you can put in data as slowly and
carefully as you like. Mistakes can be singled out and removed or
replaced without the least disturbance to any wanted event. Short of
full scale computer control (and this is also possible, of course),
there is no method of storing voltages which is so accurate and
flexible. It makes the S.100, in spite of its huge possibilities of
sound production and control, a reasonably docile creature to
handle.</p>
<p>The sequencer operating controls are all at the right hand end of the
machine — some on the vertical panel and some below, just above the
output channels. The functions of all these controls are described in
Section 4, and in Section 6 we describe some more elaborate ways of
using the sequencer.</p>
<p>The design of the S.100 does, we believe, allow for any method of
work the composer wishes to use. It can be ‘played’ in real time or
programmed slowly and carefully. It can be randomly or accurately
controlled (or anything in between). Different types of sound can be set
up at leisure one after the other but produced simultaneously. The
devices include a very full capability for transforming live
instruments, and the ideal studio location is near a performing area so
that signals can be processed and sent back to the hall.</p>
<h2 id="first-switchon-and-brief-checks">First Switch–on and Brief
Checks</h2>
<p>The S.100 will have been lined up, and is normally installed, by EMS
engineers, and no attempt should be made to alter presets or make other
internal adjustments on a new machine without specific instructions from
a qualified installer. But the following points may be useful if for any
reason you have to install it yourself, or take over a used machine.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Be quite sure, if the machine has not come direct from us, that the
mains supply is correct for the machine. If your supply is 240V, and
there is any doubt at all, first obtain a 1KVA 240–110V step–down
transformer and run the machine through it. If the machine is already
set for 240V the meter and panel lights will be very dim, and the
sequencer clock display will not light up. If everything runs normally,
you can continue to run the machine through the transformer, but if you
prefer to convert it to 240V, all the power supplies must be changed,
viz:
<ol type="1">
<li>The power supplies for the S.100 (See technical manual for
details)</li>
<li>The mains adjustment for the oscilloscope as fitted.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p>The S.100 is not suitable for DC or battery operation.</p>
</div>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The stand is normally on castors (though various special stands can
be supplied), so the S.100 can be swung out for rear access. Where space
considerations make this difficult it may be more convenient to mount it
through a partition, giving access from behind, or in some studios it
can be free–standing. Ventilation space must be provided above, as the
sequencer and the scope both need to dissipate a certain amount of heat.
Since one rarely sits at the S.100, some users prefer to raise the whole
instrument higher to make it more convenient for standing operation.
This also gives clearance to enable the keyboard to be stowed underneath
when not in use.</li>
<li>After switching on, make the following checks:
<ol type="1">
<li>Meter dial lamps on (no switch)</li>
<li>Illuminated panel lights (switch near mains switch)</li>
<li>Digital display (Sequencer Event Time). This will come on initially
at any number. Pressing CLEAR/RESET or RESET buttons should bring it to
zero, where it will stay. It will not run unless patched, so expect no
result if you press START.</li>
<li>Envelope Shaper ‘ON’ lamps. Switch all three shapers to ‘Free Run’;
DELAY and ON to 0, ATTACK and DELAY about half way. The lamps should
flash on and off.</li>
<li>Scope and Frequency Meter. The digital display on the frequency
meter should be at zero (except certain types which may be in a
time–counting mode). The scope should show two traces (if time base on
and tube controls correct).</li>
<li>You can also check all source devices on the scope, but may prefer
to do this audibly. A scope check of all oscillators, noise generators
and filters (response controls to maximum to put them into oscillation),
will, however, familiarise you with patch and panel locations, and scope
controls.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>All these simple checks can be done without connecting an output, but
temporary listening arrangements are easily made by connecting stereo
phones to Pan Outputs 1–4 Left, and 5–8 Left. Put all Pan controls to
Left. You can now listen to any output channel, but naturally in order
to use the S.100 you must make proper input/output arrangements.</p>
<h2 id="inputoutput-connections">Input/Output Connections</h2>
<p>Look at the back of the lower panel. There is a trough with an access
tunnel at each end of the machine, and all leads can be brought in from
the rear and concealed neatly in this trough. From left to right you
will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 Pan Outputs</li>
<li>8 Individual Outputs</li>
<li>4 External Treatment Sends</li>
<li>4 External Treatment Returns</li>
<li>8 Input Amplifiers (sometimes but not always there are ten sockets,
Chs. 1 and 2 having extra sockets for MIC. amps).</li>
<li>2 Option sockets</li>
<li>2 71–way connectors (one male, one female) to which the whole
Control Board is wired. 60 ways on each are used, leaving some spare
ways which can be used for other purposes</li>
<li>1 Keyboard socket</li>
<li>1 Panel Light switch</li>
<li>1 Mains Keyswitch (key removable when ON as well as OFF), with main
fuse and mains input socket beside it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="output-channels">Output Channels</h3>

<img src="Figures/figure_1_output_channels.png"
alt="Simplified diagram of output channels" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Simplified diagram of output
channels</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The figure above shows the output arrangements, from which you will
see that the Pans are in two separate groups, and can be taken to four
outputs if desired. The limitations are that you cannot cross–pan from
Outputs 1–4 to Outputs 5–8 or vice versa. The pan outputs are very
useful when you have only a limited number of monitor amplifiers and
speakers available. If necessary you can hear all 8 channels on two
output monitors (same as stereo phones connection mentioned above). With
four amplifiers use all four pan outputs. When a full studio mixer is
available, complete with its own panning arrangements, it is best to use
the individual channel outputs, and this applies also when using
multi–track tape recorders unless panning direct from S.100 to a tape
recorder. The socket connections are identical on all 12 outputs, and
you can change quickly from one type to the other. The following figure
shows the pin connections for all input and output plugs and sockets,
which are balanced lines. Signal levels should be within the range 0–16
dBM. When feeding to an unbalanced source, use earth as pin 1, Signal to
pin 3. Pin 2 is left open circuit. (Do not earth). When feeding to the
S.100 from unbalanced, separately earthed equipment, connect signal
earth to pin 2, signal high to pin 3. (This will avoid hum loops).</p>

<h3 id="treatment-sends-and-returns">Treatment Sends and Returns</h3>
<p>These are general purpose output and input lines which come up on the
Signal Board, and are very useful for interfacing with other studio
equipment, such as extra filters, reverberation plates, other
synthesizers. They can also be used as extra output or input lines. They
are individually wired (i.e. there is no special relationship between
Send 1 and Return 1), and are fitted with level controls (5K) on the
panel. No amplifiers are built in to this facility, but of course an
output amplifier can precede a Treatment Send. If extra gain is needed
for a Return, one of the Input Amplifiers should be used instead.</p>
<h3 id="input-amplifiers">Input Amplifiers</h3>
<p>These eight sockets (ten if special microphone amplifier inputs are
provided) feed eight identical input amplifiers. They are of line
sensitivity (0–16 dBu) or 10VDC Max. for 0.1% THD) and their direct
coupling makes them suitable for signals or controls. Low output
microphones need external amplifiers, and in some models Inputs 1 and 2
have special additional microphone sockets with provision for powering
these preamplifiers (which are also supplied in these cases).</p>
<p>Inputs can be from a mixer, from other electronic music equipment,
from tape recorders, electric instruments, radio, phonograph etc. In
some studios it would be most convenient to take all the output, send
and return, and input lines to a main studio patch for distribution.</p>
<h3 id="option-sockets">Option Sockets</h3>
<p>These two 8–way sockets are not wired, and are included (like the
Option knob at the right of the right hand panel) for the convenience of
the user. In any studio there must be room for expansion, and although
these sockets may never be used it was felt desirable to include some
provision for extra facilities. One obvious use would be to plug in a
button box for remote control of tape recorders.</p>
<h3 id="control-board-connectors">Control Board Connectors</h3>
<p>This plug and socket enable the entire control board to be operated
from a remote point. If the S.100 is interfaced with a computer, or its
control patch made part of an even larger patch, this facility makes it
easy to do. It can, of course, be partly used, in the sense that there
might be selected controls you wish to operate remotely (e.g. envelope
or sequencer key inputs). There are also a number of unused ways on
these plugs, so extra connections can be made.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-socket">Keyboard Socket</h3>
<p>To plug in the double 5–octave dynamically proportional keyboard
provided.</p>
<h3 id="panel-light-and-mains-input">Panel Light and Mains Input</h3>
<p>The lights under the overhang give working illumination to the lower
panels. The mains keyswitch, note, can be removed when the machine is on
as well as off. This is valuable when a sequence has been recorded and
work interrupted, in case the S.100 is accidentally switched off.</p>
<h3 id="peripherals">Peripherals</h3>
<p>Apart from the equipment already suggested — i.e. studio patch,
general purpose mixer, tape recorders, monitor amplifiers and speakers —
nothing more is essential to operate the S.100 efficiently. Two
excellent measuring devices — a double beam oscilloscope and a frequency
meter — are incorporated in the machine itself. A digital voltmeter is a
useful accessory in certain kinds of work where it is essential to
monitor very accurately the voltages being sent to the sequencer or
supplied to devices, and is supplied as an in–built facility on certain
later models. A reverberation plate is a useful refinement, and this can
be connected through the Treatment Sends and Returns. Any studio
acquires extra equipment for which there is ample provision in the
input/output arrangements of S.100. Many special circumstances can
occur, and any competent studio manager will devise suitable methods of
control. A single example will show what we mean: The sequencer has a
special Key output (Key H — see Section 6), and it might be a
requirement to make this key operate (a) a remote attack in another
synthesizer, (b) an electronic stepping device so that successive keys
perform different functions, (c) a mechanical relay to e.g. start a tape
recorder. All these things can be done — it is a matter of devising the
relatively simple peripheral arrangements you need.</p>
<p>The following two Sections deal respectively with the analogue signal
device (sources and treatments) and the analogue control devices. In
fact you will have to refer across from one description to another
fairly frequently, because it is a practical impossibility to treat each
device in isolation.</p>
<h1 id="analog-signal-devices">Analog Signal Devices</h1>
<p><strong>Signal Source</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Audio Oscillators</li>
<li>Sub-audio Oscillators (1)</li>
<li>Input Amplifiers</li>
<li>White Noise Generators</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the twelve oscillators in the S.100 (apart from the eight
Filter/Oscillators), nine are intended largely as audio sources, and
three as control sources. But since all outputs are directly coupled
(able to pass DC) these roles can be reversed, and it is largely a
matter of the frequencies required. Simply switch to high/low range as
required. The nine ‘audio’ oscillators divide into two types, but all
have the same frequency range. All have a control voltage slope of 1V
per octave. All can be locked by synchronising inputs, which ensures
perfect tracking of unisons, octaves, fifths or any other simple ratio
partial.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-1-12">Oscillators 1 – 12</h2>
<p><strong>Output 1</strong>: Sine + Sawtooth (with sine ShapeControl to
give variable amounts of even harmonic distortion)</p>
<p><strong>Output 2</strong>: Sawtooth Ramp + Pulse, with Pulse
mark–sweep variable.</p>
<p>These 12 identical oscillators have two in-phase outputs with shapes
and phase relationship as shown in the figure below. Find these outputs
on the Signal Board and the control inputs on the Control Board.</p>
<figure id="fig:figure_3_shape_control">
<img src="Figures/figure_3_shape_control.png"
alt="Shape Control and Effect on Output Signals" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Shape Control and Effect on Output
Signals</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the small synthesizers, the amount of timbre control possible
without using filters is limited by the fact that two oscillators can
never be tuned so that they are locked in phase, and beats will always
occur. Try now putting Oscs. 1 and 2 sines to output, and Osc. 1 ramp to
synch. input 2. For the moment keep Osc. 1 ramp level at zero, and tune
the two oscillators an octave apart, Osc. 2 being the higher. Monitor
both on <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sub>1</sub></span> (two
pins); however carefully you tune, the picture will slowly drift as the
relative phase changes, and slow beats will occur. Now bring up the ramp
output of Osc. 1; at a certain point the waveform (and the sound) will
lock, and there will be the illusion of one sound source instead of two
(particularly if Osc. 2 sine level is set somewhat lower than Osc. 1, to
simulate a ‘natural’ second harmonic). This facility enables timbres to
be constructed additively, by adding sines to build the desired harmonic
structure. There is no reason why you cannot use ramps as well, but the
harmonic structure is more difficult to predict (but see below).</p>
<p>The main thing to remember when using synch. inputs is that they
cannot lock unless they are near to a simple frequency ratio (2:1 in the
above example, but 1:1, 3:1, 8:1 etc). If you are way off tune the
oscillator being controlled will give an unstable output. Try this by
moving Osc. 2 frequency slowly. As soon as it is far enough off for Osc.
1 to be unable to lock the octave, it will switch rapidly from one
frequency to another (a complicated function of both the frequency and
amplitude of the synch. input). As soon as it finds the next simple
ratio it will lock again (the fourth below the octave or the fifth
above, etc). So you can synchronise a whole harmonic series, within
reason.</p>
<p>For a more complete study, tune all six oscillators as follows:
<em>first put in control pins</em> from some suitable control source.
Unless you do this before tuning you will have to do it all again. For
this experiment take a joystick output, which will enable us to track
our constructed timbre through several octaves (a static timbre at this
stage, of course, with no internal variations or envelope). Put white
(100K) pins at C11+26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31. Set lefthand joystick (q.v.)
vertical range control to give about 3–4 octaves when the stick is moved
up and down, and leave stick towards the low pitch end (towards you).
Tune Osc. 1 to a low note, put all six sines to one output, and insert a
synch. pin from Osc. 1 ramp to Osc. 2 synch. input. Follow the series
shown in Fig. 4(a) — i.e., tune Osc. 2 to the octave above, setting the
frequency control in the centre of ‘locked’ area, and the ramp output at
or near maximum. Continue to put in synch. pins after tuning each
oscillator as near as possible to successive harmonics, then check them.
Tune slave oscillators on low side if anything, as synchronisation tends
to raise frequency.</p>
<p>When you get to Oscs. 5 and 6, you may choose various configurations
from harmonics 5–10 or higher (or you can miss out one or two of the
lower harmonics and use more higher ones). Locking the higher harmonics
becomes more difficult as they are much closer together and the ratios
larger. Now adjust sine levels so that the fundamental is loudest and
progressively reduce the level of each harmonic (this for a start — you
can alter the timbre a great deal by changing internal amplitudes). Try
moving the joystick. Some of the oscillators may go out of lock at some
point. Readjust for best holding. It is asking a great deal to expect
synchronisation of, say, the 7th harmonic for five octaves or more, but
it should be possible over at least four octaves. It is also worth
trying different synch. pin arrangements. For example, State 2 on
Specimen Patch 1 locks Oscs. 2 and 3 from 1, but 4 and 5 from 2 (the
octave of 1), and 6 from 4 (the double octave). This may work better,
but you have to try different arrangements. Sometimes a double–locked
arrangement is best, with mutual synch. pins between oscillators. Note
that the synch. input is driven from output you are not using for signal
— otherwise you could not reduce the signal level for the sound you want
without losing the synch. input level.</p>
<p>Look at Fig. 4(b). This shows an alternative timbre structure using a
sawtooth output on the second harmonic (change synch. also if you are
using State 2). The waveform itself now contributes to the timbre
(coming up on even harmonics of the fundamental), and the sound will be
richer, but buzzy at the top. Remove some of the upper harmonics by
putting the whole complex through the Eight Octave Filter Bank (q.v.).
Set all the lower controls of the Filter Bank at No. 10, and slope off
to 0 at the highest octave.</p>
<p>This method of timbre construction can give extremely rich organ-like
tones, and you can experiment with emphasising certain harmonics. You
can also, of course, try different series altogether, but you will not
achieve lock unless the relationships are fairly simple.</p>
